    "## Introduction to the problem\n",
    "In Module 1, you are going to get familiar with pandas, the python module which is used to process and analyse data. Processing could include removing unknown values from the data or replacing unknown values with values which make sense, maybe 0. Analysing the data could include finding out the trend of a stock price, e.g. how the stock price changes with respect to the Nifty 50 basket of stocks.\n",

    "[Basics of Financial Markets](http://www.aspiration.ai/machine-learning/internship/Basics%20of%20Financial%20Markets.pdf)\n",
    "##### 1. Share:\n",
    "a share is a ‘part’ of a company which you can buy or sell, IF the company is publicly listed i.e. on a stock exchange.\n",
    "##### 2. Market Capitalization (Market Cap): \n",
    "the total number of shares of a company multiplied by the price of a share.\n",
    "##### 3. Stocks: \n",
    "refer to any arbitrary company. e.g. Akash owns **Stocks**\n",
    "##### 4. Shares: \n",
    "referring to a specific company. e.g Saurabh owns **shares** of Coca-Cola Company\n",
    "##### 5. Portfolio:\n",
    "If I have invested in more stocks than 1, let’s say 10 different stocks, then this collection of investment is known as a Portfolio.\n",
    "##### 6. Market Index:\n",
    "- identify a few companies to represent the broader markets. \n",
    "- So every time someone asks you how the markets are doing, you would just check the general trend of these selected stocks and then give an answer. \n",
    "- These companies that you have identified collectively make upthe stock market index.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 7. Nifty: \n",
    "Nifty is the market index which represents the top 50 companies listed on the NSE(National Stock Exchange)\n",
    "##### 8. Sensex:\n",
    "Sensex is the market index which represents the top 30 companies listed on the BSE(Bombay Stock Exchange)\n",
    "##### 9. Market capitalization:\n",
    "Market capitalization is the product of total number of shares outstanding in the market, and the price of the stock.\n",
    "##### 10. Trend:\n",
    "A term ‘trend’ usually refers to the general market direction, and its associated strength. For example, if the market is declining fast, the trend is said to be bearish. If the market is trading flat with no movement then the trend is said to be sideways.\n",
    "##### 11. Volume (Total Traded Quantity):\n",
    "Volumes and its impact on the stock prices is an important concept . Volumes represent the total transactions (both buy and sell put together) for a particular stock on a particular day. For example, on 17thJune 2019, the volume on ACC was 5,33,819 shares.\n",
    "##### 12. Deliverable Quantity:\n",
    "All the shares which were not squared off on an intraday basis.\n",
    "##### 13. Turnover \n",
    "Product of total volume traded to the average price of a stock for the day\n",
    "##### 14. Previous close: \n",
    "Previous close is a security's closing price on the preceding day of trading. Previous close can refer to the prior day's value of a stock, bond, commodity, futures or option contract, market index, or any other security."
